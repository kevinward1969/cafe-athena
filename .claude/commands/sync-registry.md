description: Syncs The Manual/recipes.json against the live Manual directory. Adds missing entries, updates stage flags that can be derived from the filesystem, and reports any discrepancies. Does not remove entries or reset completed stages.

# Sync Registry Workflow

Invoked with: `/sync-registry`

---

## Phase 1 — Scan The Manual

1. Use Glob to find all `*.md` files under `The Manual/Chapter*/`.
2. For each file, extract:
   - `index` — the XX-YY or XX-YYa prefix
   - `title` — display name (strip index prefix and `Café Athena - ` / `Technique Folio - ` prefixes)
   - `type` — `"technique"` if filename contains "Technique Folio", otherwise `"recipe"`
   - `chapter` and `chapterName` — from the parent folder name
3. Build a **live set** of all index values found in The Manual.
4. Also read `The Manual/Cafe-Athena-The-Manual-Current-Version.md` and build a **doc set** of all `XX-YY` (and `XX-YY.N` variant) indices listed in that human-facing TOC. Treat `_` and `.` as equivalent separators when comparing variant suffixes (registry uses `07-10_2`; doc uses `07-10.2`).

---

## Phase 2 — Read Current Registry

1. Read `The Manual/recipes.json`.
2. Build a **registry set** of all `id` values currently in the `recipes` array.

---

## Phase 3 — Identify Gaps and Drift

Compare the sets:

- **Missing entries** — in live set but not in registry set → will be added
- **Orphaned entries** — in registry but no matching file in The Manual → flag only, do not remove
- **Doc drift** — registered indices not present in the Current-Version doc set → will be appended to the human-facing TOC
- **Stage drift** — for existing entries, re-check filesystem-derivable stages and flag if they differ from the registry value:
  - `heroImage` — check for `{index}.webp` in `site/public/images/`
  - `heroImageOptimized` — check for `{index}.webp` in `site/public/images/`
  - `referenceImages` — check for `{index}[a-z].webp` in `site/public/images/`
  - `referenceImagesProcessed` — check if any `{index}[a-z].png` still exist in `site/public/images/`
  - `glossaryPull` — check for `## Glossary` section in source file
  - `clarityAudit` — cannot be derived from filesystem; leave existing value unchanged. If field is absent from an entry, add it as `false`.

---

## Phase 4 — Report *(STOP POINT)*

Present a summary before making any changes:

```
SYNC REPORT
───────────────────────────────────────
Missing entries (will be added):    N
  - 10-24 — New Recipe Title
  - ...

Orphaned entries (no file found):   N
  - XX-YY — Title (flagged only, not removed)

Doc drift (registered but not in Current-Version doc): N
  - XX-YY — Title (will be appended to chapter TOC)
  - ...

Stage drift (filesystem vs registry): N
  - 04-11: heroImage registry=false → filesystem=true
  - ...

No changes:                         N entries already in sync
───────────────────────────────────────
```

Ask: *"Apply these changes? Orphaned entries will be flagged but not deleted."*

**WAIT** for confirmation.

---

## Phase 5 — Apply Changes

For each **missing entry**:
1. Detect initial stage state from filesystem (same logic as `/register-recipe` Phase 3).
2. Create entry with `"added": "{today's date}"`.
3. Append to `recipes` array.

For each **stage drift** item:
1. Update only the specific stage field(s) that differ.
2. Do not touch stages that were manually set (e.g., `formatAudit: true`).

For each **orphaned entry**:
1. Add `"orphaned": true` flag to the entry.
2. Do not delete — let the user decide.

For each **doc drift** item (and for any newly added missing entry):
1. Open `The Manual/Cafe-Athena-The-Manual-Current-Version.md`.
2. Locate the `## CHAPTER {chapter}: ...` heading for the entry's chapter.
3. Find the last existing folio line in that chapter section.
4. Insert the new entry **immediately after** the last folio line, preserving the chapter's existing list style (`*` vs `-`, escaped `\-` vs unescaped `-`).
5. Format: `{bullet} {index} {prefix} {title}` — `{prefix}` is `Technique Folio` for techniques, `Café Athena` for recipes.
6. Append-only — do not reformat or normalize other lines.

Re-sort the `recipes` array by `id` ascending.

Write the updated `The Manual/recipes.json` and `The Manual/Cafe-Athena-The-Manual-Current-Version.md`.

## Phase 6 — Confirm

Report:
```
✅ Registry synced.
   Added:         N new entries
   Updated:       N stage flags corrected
   Flagged:       N orphaned entries
   Total entries: N
```
