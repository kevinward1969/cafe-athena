# Café Athena

**A culinary manuscript system — AI-powered recipe development, technique education, and a published digital cookbook.**

Café Athena is a structured three-mode methodology for professional recipe development, backed by a published Astro website. The Manual is the source-of-truth manuscript; the site is the digital face of it.

---

## Overview

The system operates in three modes:

- **The Lab** (Mode 1): Iterative recipe development with technical AI feedback
- **The Manual** (Mode 2): Manuscript-ready formatting with automatic indexing
- **The MasterClass** (Mode 3): Deep-dive technique education and folio creation

All content follows rigorous standards for food science, formatting precision, and pedagogical clarity.

## 🌐 The Website

The Astro site is the published face of the cookbook.

**Stack:** Astro 6, Tailwind CSS 4, GSAP, Pagefind (full-text search)

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Homepage |
| `/larder` | Recipes browsed by chapter |
| `/academy` | Technique folios by chapter |
| `/glossary` | Full culinary glossary |
| `/search` | Full-text search (Pagefind) |
| `/brigade` | About |

### Content Pipeline

Manual → Site is a one-command transform:

```bash
cd site
python scripts/prepare-content.py   # converts The Manual → src/content/recipes/
npm run build                        # builds + indexes for Pagefind
```

`prepare-content.py` reads Markdown files from `The Manual/`, transforms them into Astro-compatible frontmatter, and writes compiled files to `site/src/content/recipes/`.

### Images

There are two image types: **hero images** (one per recipe, shown at the top of the recipe page) and **reference images** (inline figures within the recipe body).

**Naming convention:**

| Type | Filename pattern | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hero image | `{index}.webp` | `04-16.webp` |
| Reference image | `{index}{letter}.webp` | `04-16a.webp`, `04-16b.webp` |

**Source of truth:** All images live in their chapter folder inside `The Manual/` (e.g., `The Manual/Chapter 4 - The Mill/04-16.webp`). The `prepare-content.py` pipeline copies them into `site/public/images/` on every build. **Never edit `site/public/images/` directly** — it is fully managed by the pipeline.

#### Hero Image Workflow

Use `/recipe-hero-image` (three modes):

| Mode | Command | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | `/recipe-hero-image 04-17` | Reads recipe frontmatter + headnote, builds a Gemini prompt, hands off to you to generate and save the PNG |
| Insert | `/recipe-hero-image insert 04-11 "after the shapes list" "Caption"` | Inserts a `[ref:]` shortcode at the right position in the source folio and assigns the next available letter |
| Optimize | `/recipe-hero-image optimize 04-17` | Converts PNG → WebP (quality 85, max 1920×1080), deletes the original |

You can also optimize a full chapter or everything at once:

```
/recipe-hero-image optimize chapter-4
/recipe-hero-image optimize all
```

#### Reference Image Shortcode

Place this shortcode as a standalone paragraph (blank line above, blank line below) anywhere in the recipe body:

```
[ref:04-16a | The laminated pasta dough at final thickness]
```

The custom remark plugin (`remark-ref-images.mjs`) transforms it into a captioned `<figure>` pulling from `public/images/04-16a.webp`. Letters are assigned sequentially — if `04-16a` and `04-16b` already exist, the next is `04-16c`. Use `/recipe-hero-image insert` to handle this automatically.

## 🎓 The Three Modes

### Mode 1: The Lab — Recipe Development

- **Goal:** Develop and iterate on a recipe
- **Input:** Concept + rough ingredients
- **Output:** Tested recipe (not yet formatted)
- **Process:** Iterative refinement (1–10 passes)
- **Exit:** User says "Finalize" or "Ready for Manual"

**Starter:**

```
"Let's work on a risotto. I want to focus on starch leaching
and how it creates that creamy texture without cream. Starting
ingredients: Carnaroli rice, homemade stock, white wine,
butter, Parmigiano."
```

### Mode 2: The Manual — Production Formatting

- **Goal:** Convert a tested recipe to manuscript-ready format
- **Input:** Finalized recipe from Mode 1
- **Output:** Formatted recipe + INDEX DATA block
- **Process:** Single-pass formatting + auto-indexing
- **Requirement:** Chapter must be identified; Manual scanned for next sequence number

**Starter:**

```
"Format this for publication. Chapter: Chapter 4 - The Mill.
Here's the finalized version: [recipe text]"
```

### Mode 3: The MasterClass — Technique Education

- **Goal:** Educate on a culinary technique
- **Input:** Technique topic + specific questions
- **Output:** Tutorial → (on request) Technique Folio
- **Template:** `Technique_Folio_Template_v1.md`

**Starter:**

```
"Teach me about the Maillard reaction — not just browning,
the actual chemistry and how temperature affects it."
```

## ⚡ Claude Code Workflows

Slash commands for common tasks — type directly in the Antigravity chat (Claude Code):

| Command | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/new-recipe` | `/new-recipe` | Scaffold a new recipe through Mode 1 |
| `/format-audit` | `/format-audit 04-15` or `/format-audit Chapter 4` | Audit a recipe against format standards with authorization layer |
| `/glossary-pull` | `/glossary-pull 04-15` | Extract and merge glossary terms from a recipe |
| `/audit-glossary` | `/audit-glossary` | Fix alphabetization + duplicates in the main glossary |
| `/keyword-pull` | `/keyword-pull 04-15` | Extract keywords for site metadata |
| `/recipe-hero-image` | `/recipe-hero-image 04-15` | Generate a hero image brief for a recipe |

Workflow definitions live in `Guidance/workflows/`.

---

## 📋 Format Standards

Every recipe must include, in strict order:

1. Title Block (3 separate lines)
2. Headnote (2–5 sentences + Teaching Idea)
3. Mise en Place (action checklist — no cooking steps)
4. Ingredients (grouped by component)
5. Method (phased instructions with sensory cues)
6. Chef's Notes / Variations
7. Glossary (technical terms defined)

See `Guidance/Recipe-Format-Standard.md` for the full specification.

**Zero-Citation Protocol:** No `[source]`, `[1]`, `[cite]`, or bracketed references. All references are integrated into text or the glossary. Content is manuscript-ready.

---

## 🗂️ Indexing System

Every recipe and folio has a unique index in `XX-YY` format:

- `XX` = Chapter number (zero-padded)
- `YY` = Sequential entry number within the chapter

Example: `04-11` = Chapter 4, entry 11.

Reference images extend this with a letter suffix: `04-11a`, `04-11b`.

Claude scans the live Manual directory before assigning any new number to prevent conflicts.

---

## 🛡️ Critical Constraints

- **Food Safety:** Claude stops on HACCP violations or unsafe temperatures
- **Format Validation:** Claude enforces `Recipe-Format-Standard.md`
- **Index Integrity:** Claude scans the live Manual before assigning any number
- **Stop Points:** Critical decisions require user confirmation before proceeding

---

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Astro Site

```bash
cd site
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server at localhost:4321
npm run build      # production build + Pagefind index
npm run preview    # preview production build
```

### Content Pipeline

Run after adding or editing any files in `The Manual/`:

```bash
cd site
python scripts/prepare-content.py
```
